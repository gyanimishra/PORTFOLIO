              When I started my coding journey it was amidst a lot of skepticism, as I was moving from compition-preparation-world to computer- science. I feel that it is never too late to start something you actually like. During my final year, I started learning coding from YouTube and documentations. After 6 months of coding, I was confident that I wanted to pursue coding as my career.

              To enhance my knowledge and get proper guidance, I joined Masai School. Currently, I am pursuing a Full Stack Web Development course and with the help of Masai School my journey has come a long way. I have a good command over programming languageâ€“JavaScript and I am also learning backend frameworks which include MERN stack.

              Apart from coding, I focus on physical and mental fitness for which I go to the gym, play cricket, and chess.
